# Types of Threat Intelligence

There are different types of threat intelligence that organizations and teams may priorqitize in different ways. The general ones we always see are:

## Strategic
This is mainly high level information that senior leadership can use to make decisions on long term strategies the company will take in regards to security. This usually be very non-technical information as opposed to more detailed information you get in the other types. Some examples include:
1. Regulations
2. Knowing the competitors and what they are setting for policies
3. Regional and National news
4. Social Media buzz and hot topics
5. Trends seen in the security realm, such as certain upticks in ransomware

Strategic data can help the leadership understand likelihood of certain events to factor into their risk assessments. Its also useful to them to determine what the current security posture is as it will affect budget talks. Understanding any new laws or compliance requirements so that we stay within legal parameters is also important to them. This would be long term planning.

## Tactical 
This one focuses more on TTPs, and gives insight into potential attacks that could impact the organization. This is generally shorter term than Strategic, but still not immediate action like Operational. Some examples include:
1. URL and IP blacklists
2. Malware trends and IOCs
3. Ransomware families and trends
4. Known phishing scenarios
5. Known TTPs against known software and systems that the organization uses

A lot of this Tactical Intel can be found:
1. Dark Web Monitoring
2. Telegram Channel monitoring
3. Hacking Forums
4. Security Blogs
5. Malware analysis
6. MITRE Att&ck

Tactical is usually seen as being right in the middle of Operational and Strategic. It is less reactionary than Operational and it also helps Threat Hunting teams with given data points used for hunts

## Operational
This one is more reactionary than the other two. Think of it being intel given to the SOC to assist them with investigating an ongoing incident. They may ask Threat Intel team for OSINT on an email or Social Media handle. They may ask if the command they are seeing is part of a broader attack chain. they may want to know if anomalous network behaviour may indicate C2 activity or a port scan. There is crossover from Tactical as some things researched in the Tactical intel may be relevant to the ongoing security event.
