# Email Threat Intel

## EmailHarvester


**Description**: A tool to retrieve Domain email addresses from Search Engines
```
python3 EmailHarvester.py -d wingnut.com -r bing -s results.txt
```

-r is to exclude, Bing gave me an error the first time so i just excluded it, or just use emailharvester as I installed it with PIP


## Holehe

**Description**: Holehe checks if an email is attached to an account on sites like twitter, instagram, imgur and more than 120 others.
```
holehe wingnut@gmail.com -C
```

-C generates a CSV file with the results
