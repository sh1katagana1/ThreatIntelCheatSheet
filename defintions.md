In the context of Threat Intelligence, it is good to understand certain terminology

## Threat

## Data vs Intelligence
Data is the raw information obtain from sources like an intel feed. Intelligence is enriching this data and forming it into something usable and relevant for your environment

## Pyramid of Pain
The Pyramid of Pain is a conceptual model for the effective use of Cyber Threat Intelligence in threat detection operations, with a particular emphasis on increasing the adversaries' cost of operations. http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html

## Indicators of Compromise
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are the digital and informational "clues" that incident responders use to detect, diagnose, halt, and remediate malicious activity in their networks.- Some examples can be IP address, File Hash, Domain, etc.

## TTP
Tactics, Techniques and Procedures. A simple way to explain it is a threat actors behaviour. Tactics would represent a broader behaviour, like Initial Access. Techniques would represent a way that the threat actor may do the Tactic, like Spearphishing. A Procedure is a known action documented that a threat actor did that represents that technique, like APT1 has sent spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files.

## OSINT
Open Source Intelligence. The use of public sources, like a Google search, to gather information about a specific topic that is publicly known and published.
